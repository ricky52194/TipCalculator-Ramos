# TipCalculator-Ramos

# README

## Instructions:  
Create an app that takes an input for an amount, an input for number of people spliting the check, a series of radio buttons for pre-determined tip amounts with the last radio button allowing for custom tip ammount, a button to reset the values, and a button to calculate the tip and total amount. The amounts (tip, total, and total per person) must be displayed as a TextView. All values must retain its state when the phone is rotated between portrait and landscape modes or any other instances where the app cycles through the activity lifecycle. There should be no values, such as strings, dimensions, etc. hardcoded in the .java files. They should be maintained and accessed from the appropriate resource files. An error message should be displayed to the user if they try to input a bill amount less than $1, total people less than 1, or a tip percentage less than 1%.

## WOW Factors:
1. Custom toast messages are displayed depending on which tip button you pick.  
2. Colorful, circular buttons have been added for RESET, CALCULATE, and RETURN.  
3. All backgrounds have been changed to a bluish color.  
4. An intent was used to start another activity which displays all the calculations in an easy-to-read format for the user.
